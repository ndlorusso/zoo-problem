      Louisiana black bears (Ursus americanus luteolus) are a subspecies of the
      American black bear. They are active at night and go through a dormancy
      period rather than a true hibernation in the winter. They are smaller and
      have a more narrow skull than other black bears.

      Giraffes are considered gentle giants, which is no surprise considering
      they have the largest heart of any land mammal! At birth, giraffes weigh
      150 pounds and can be up to 6 feet tall. On average, giraffes are 15-18
      feet tall, and their tongues are 18-20 inches long.

      While lions are a social big cat and are often found in 'prides', there is
      no strict social structure. Some animals, both male and female, can be
      solitary and other times males may form coalitions. The most notable
      feature is seen on the males- the mane. African lions are carnivores and
      considered to be generalist hunters that will eat any species they can
      catch.

      Geoffroy’s spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi), also called black-handed
      spider monkeys, live in groups in the upper levels of the rainforest. Ripe
      fruit makes up the largest part of their diet, although they will eat
      plants and even small insects.
